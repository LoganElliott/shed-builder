# NZ Digital Practical Assessment

This practical assessment is to assess your ability with React, Node.js, and documentation. 

We expect for you to explain your decisions while building this small application. 

For your React component you will use https://github.com/insin/nwb to create your component, you can select if you want to use a css preprocessors like sass, or just use css (https://github.com/insin/nwb/blob/master/docs/Plugins.md#plugins) 

For your Node.js service, you will use a simple HTTP server such as express (completely your decision, explain why you selected this)

We will provide you a Sketch file containing the designs for the page (https://www.sketchapp.com/), if you don’t have mac please work from the supplied PDF. 

## The Task 

The task is to build a simple form where a user selects a shed model, and provides accessories that they want to purchase. 

Once the user submits the form you will need to create a PDF containing all the details of the submitted form using PDFKit (https://github.com/devongovett/pdfkit), once the PDF is created, send an email to your own email address and fabian@nzdigital.co.nz

The PDF should include:
A header saying “Shed builder model”
Image of the shed
Shed model
Floor selected
Accessories selected and quantity

We don’t expect the PDF to have any design to it, and a straightforward list is acceptable
